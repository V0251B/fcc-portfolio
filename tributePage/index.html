                    the organization Creative Commons, the website framework web.py, and joined the social news
                    site Reddit six months after its founding. He was given the title of co-founder of Reddit by Y
                    Combinator owner Paul Graham after the formation of Not a Bug, Inc. (a merger of Swartz's project
                    Infogami and Redbrick Solutions, a company run by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman). Swartz's
                    work also focused on civic awareness and activism. He helped launch the Progressive Change
                    Campaign Committee in 2009 to learn more about effective online activism. In 2010, he became a
                    research fellow at Harvard University's Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption, directed by
                    Lawrence Lessig. He founded the online group Demand Progress, known for its campaign against
                    the Stop Online Piracy Act.</p>
